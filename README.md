Hello!

Comments: 
Looks like this website doesn't actually delete/edit the computers listed, if they did that i would try to buffer the info entered and then use on the search for example, but since it's not working i only did it until the ribbon of success after creating/editing/deleting
i created more like a modular end-2-end for better understanding.

To run:

clone the repo
npm install

to run all the tests: npm run cypress:run
to open the cypress runner: npm run cypress:open
